# React-gallery
<h1>Project</h1>
This is a gallery application project i started to get to know react. Firebase is used to store and fetch images with diffrent categories also hook-routes are used to redirect to routes(categories). As of now there are 3 categories 'Nature', 'Fantasy' and 'other' based on route you will be able to upload and see picture within that route.

<h1> how to run</h1>
You will need firebase installed and from firebase you will need storage and firebase to store and fetch images. fairly easy process here is a link https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup , paste your firebaseConfig in src/firebase/config.js. I suggest to allow everything in firebase storage by clicking on rules and removing everything after write and end with semicolon and click publish, to make things simple.
